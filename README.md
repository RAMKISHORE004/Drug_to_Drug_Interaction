# Drug_to_Drug_Interaction

Overview:
This repository contains the implementation of GNN-DDI, a deep learning-based model for predicting drug-drug interaction (DDI) events using graph neural networks (GNNs). In this project we implement Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Prediction using various machine learning and deep learning models. It applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation to classify drug interactions. The model integrates drug features from various sources into an attributed heterogeneous network and applies deep learning techniques for event classification.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalizing, and feature engineering on drug interaction data.
Baseline Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest.
Deep Learning Model: BioBERT, a transformer-based model for DDI classification.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): for feature extraction from an attributed heterogeneous network.
Class Imbalance Handling: Generating synthetic negative samples.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Cross-validation and model fine-tuning.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
